# IST-Main : Inferential Statistics
The scope include advanced charting with probaility distributions, hypothesis tesing methods, predicting with regression options, ANOVA testing and many more.

## Key DST Projects
- [Testing two blood pressure drugs](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project1-IST-P-Value-For-Testing-Effectiveness-Of-Blood-Pressure-Drugs)  : Testing if a new drug lowers blood pressure more effectively than an old drug. This is a hypothesis testing method by calculating t-statistic and P value.
- [Testing Effectiveness of a New Drug for Lowering Blood Pressure](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project2-IST-Using-Z-Value-To-Check-Effectiveness-Of-Blood-Pressure-Drug)  : A pharmaceutical company developed a new drug intended to lower blood pressure. To determine the drug's effectiveness, a clinical trial was conducted. Researchers wanted to see if there was a statistically significant difference in blood pressure levels before and after administering the drug..
- [Probability of new disease cases using Poisson Distribution](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project3-IST-New-Cases-Estimation-Using-Poisson-Distribution)  : A healthcare scenario where a hospital wants to estimate the incidence of a rare disease, such as a particular type of cancer, in their region. The goal is to predict how many new cases will be reported in a month based on historical data.
